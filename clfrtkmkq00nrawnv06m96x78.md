Welcome back to our DevOps series! In this blog, we will be discussing the best resources to learn and master DevOps, from beginner to pro level. DevOps is a critical aspect of software development that focuses on collaboration, communication, and automation between development and operations teams to deliver high-quality software faster and more efficiently. With the increasing demand for DevOps professionals in the industry, it is essential to keep up-to-date with the latest technologies and tools. In this blog, we have curated a list of the best resources to help you learn and master DevOps.

> **NOTE: This list has been curated based on the path which I followed and learned as a suggestion and advice from DevOps trainees working remotely**

## What is DevOps?

* Before diving into the resources, let's first understand what DevOps is. DevOps is a set of practices that combine software development (Dev) and information technology operations (Ops) to shorten the systems development life cycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently and reliably. It emphasizes collaboration, automation, monitoring, and measurement throughout the entire software delivery process.
